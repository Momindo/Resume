  <p>Hi, My name is <stron><a href="WEB.html">Momin Abdelmoniem</a></stron>,

    I am writing to express my interest in the Computer Hardware Engineer job at UAEU. I am a Bsc of degree
    candidate at Sudan University of Science and Technology, specializing in Electronics Engineering-Industrial
    Electronics. I come from a solid technical background with a strong interest in Hardware. My area of focus and
    interest varies from quantitative analysis to project management. I have maintained a 3.06 GPA through a wellbalanced program of study, which is not only very analytical and technical by nature but also helps to build
    leadership and team-building qualities. I am extremely impressed with University’s approach to strategy
    consulting, especially within the Engineering and Innovation practice areas. I believe my academic background,
    technical knowledge, and industry experiences have provided me with the credentials needed to thrive as an
    Engineer.
    Prior to MTC Company, Worked within a team of volunteers 'NOOR' on designing a solar racing car to participate
    in the World Solar Challenge in Australia. Leading the electrical and electronic team we designed and
    programmed fully Solar car sensing, metering, communications, Solar and Battery Power management, and
    Motor systems. I gained solid research, analytical and problem-solving skills. My background in generating
    innovative ideas and strategies to improve processes has provided me with a deeper understanding of
    multifaceted problems that companies encounter in their daily operations. Moreover, because of my work
    experiences, I fully understand how important it is to have great team dynamics in today’s multi-disciplinary
    business environment.
    To date, my experience as an Embedded System Engineer has been extremely rewarding and productive.
    However, it is through strategy consulting that I can use my analytical aptitude and creative problem-solving skills
    to their fullest. I strongly believe that consulting is a discipline that will force me to view problems not only from
    the client’s standpoint but also from a marketplace, best practices and “think out of the box” point of view.
    I would appreciate the opportunity to interview with UAEU for the Computer Hardware Engineer. Please find
    enclosed my resume for your review. I can be reached via email at momindoakad1@gmail.com or by phone at
    +971561899593. I enthusiastically look forward to hearing from you soon.
    Thank you for your time and consideration.
    Sincerely

    Momin Abdelmoniem</p>
